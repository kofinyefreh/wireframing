## What is Wireframing?
Wireframing is a crucial step in the design process, serving as a blueprint or skeletal framework of a website or application. It outlines the basic structure and layout without delving into detailed design elements like colors, fonts, or images. Wireframes focus on the placement of elements, navigation flow, and overall user interface structure.
### Importance of Wireframing
- Clarifies ideas and concepts
- Facilitates communication
- Identifies userbility issues
- Saves time and resources
- Provides a clear layout and structure

## Key Elements Found in a Wireframe
A wireframe must contain the follwing key elements
- **Layout Structure:** Defines the arrangement of elements on the page.
- **Navigation:** Shows how users will move through the site or application.
- **Content Placement:** Indicates where text, images, and other content will be positioned.
- **Functionality:** Outlines key functionalities and interactions.

## Types of Wireframes
### Low-Fidelity
Low-fidelity wireframes are simple, rough sketches or digital layouts that outline the basic structure and layout of a user interface (UI) without detailed design elements - more like the skeleton of how the entire platform will look like.
### High-Fidelity
High-fidelity wireframes are more detailed and refined versions, often closer to the final design, including more specific layout and design elements. This is an enhanced form of the low-fidelity wireframes

## Explanation of What Kind of Wireframe Being Used
The wireframe in there for the AirBnb clone is classified as a high fidelity wireframe. This is becuase it contains detailed, specific layouts and design elements ready to be built. Also, the wireframes are production ready anc closer to a final design. It can be handed over to developers to start working on it.

## Wireframing Tools
There are numerous wireframing tools out there but the recommentded one is Figma. A powerful, web-based design and prototyping tool widely used for creating low- and high-fidelity wireframes.
### Key Features 
- It is web-based and cross-platform. This means it works perfectly on any other OS.
- Real-Time Collaboration: Multiple users can work on the same wireframe simultaneously—great for team brainstorming and feedback.
- Design Libraries & Plugins: Access to wireframing kits and community-made plugins to speed up design workflows.
- Version History: Keeps track of changes so you can revert or review past edits easily.
- Design Libraries & Plugins: Access to wireframing kits and community-made plugins to speed up design workflows.

## Benefits of Wireframing
- Clarifies requirements early
- Reduces unnecessary cost
- Guides UI development
- Support Agile development
- Encourges user-centric thinking

### How Wireframes guide design process
Wireframes simplify complex ideas, speed up design decisions, and make communication smoother between designers, developers, and stakeholders. They’re essential blueprints that keep everyone on the same page—literally and figuratively—throughout the software development lifecycle.
