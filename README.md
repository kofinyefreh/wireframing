## What is Wireframing?
Wireframing is a crucial step in the design process, serving as a blueprint or skeletal framework of a website or application. It outlines the basic structure and layout without delving into detailed design elements like colors, fonts, or images. Wireframes focus on the placement of elements, navigation flow, and overall user interface structure.
### Importance of Wireframing
- Clarifies ideas and concepts

- Saves time and resources
- Provides a clear layout and structure

## Key Elements Found in a Wireframe
A wireframe must contain the follwing key elements
- **Layout Structure:** Defines the arrangement of elements on the page.

## Types of Wireframes
### Low-Fidelity
Low-Fidelity wireframes are simple sketches or basic digital layouts focusing on overall structure and functionality without detailed design.

High-fidelity wireframes are more detailed and refined versions, often closer to the final design, including more specific layout and design elements. This is an enhanced form of the low-fidelity wireframes
